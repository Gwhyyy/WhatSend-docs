# Get Started

The **Get Started** screen will be shown to the user right after the [Splash Screen](splash-screen.md), by default it will be shown just on the very first Application opening, the next time the user will open the Application, he will be redirect to the main page without seeing this.

However, you can configure it to be shown every time the user opens the Application [from here](/installation/configuration/app-custom-config/enable-get-started-always)
