# Install VScode For Code Editing

:::note Note
You can build apps with Flutter using any text editor combined with Flutter’s command-line tools. However, we recommend using one of our editor plugins for an even better experience. These plugins provide you with code completion, syntax highlighting, widget editing assists, run & debug support, and more.

:::note Note 2
You can edit, run and build the app on Android Studio, However VScode is just a personal recommendation for situations like this because it's simpler to use.

:::note Note
If you have already **VScode** installed on your machine, you can skip to the next step.
